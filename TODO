LIBRARY
=======
* test suite against NFIQ compliance set
* make library optionally asynchronous and maybe thread-safe
* One thread is globally, maybe one thread should be user per device.
* async callbacks report done before everything actually
  is done and freed.
* Make the imgdev support verify-retries and multiple enrolls.
* Make the library optionally synchronous. sync.c is consuming
  excessive cpu cycles.
* nbis cleanups
* API function to determine if img device supports uncond. capture
* race-free way of saying "save this print but don't overwrite"
* Unassigned enum constants in fprint.h might break depending
  software if not careful while changing fprint.h
* Might not stop as asked to.
* Use glib debugging
* Make a convenient api that ties into glib applications main loop,
  not necessarily complete, focus on ease of use.

NEW DRIVERS
===========
Sunplus 895 driver
AES3400/3500 driver
ID Mouse driver
Support for 2nd generation MS devices
Support for 2nd generation UPEK devices

IMAGING
=======
ignore first frame or two with aes2501
aes2501: increase threshold "sum" for end-of-image detection
aes2501 gain calibration
aes4000 gain calibration
aes4000 resampling
PPMM parameter to get_minutiae seems to have no effect
nbis minutiae should be stored in endian-independent format
* aeslib.c is broken. Using libusb async calls as if they were sync.

PORTABILITY
===========
OpenBSD can't do -Wshadow or visibility
OpenBSD: add compat codes for ENOTSUP ENODATA and EPROTO
